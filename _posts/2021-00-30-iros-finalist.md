Such a nice suprise, hitting me during my participation at the IROS 2021 conference: our paper "Few-leaf Learning: Weed Segmentation in Grasslands" has been among the four Finalists for the Best Paper Award on Agri-Robotics. In the end, we didn't win the award, but it is still an honour to be selected from that huge pool of high-quality agricultural papers.

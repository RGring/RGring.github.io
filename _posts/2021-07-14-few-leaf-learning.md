Our Paper "Few-leaf Learning: Weed Segmentation in Grasslands" has been accepted at IEEE's International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2021). The motivation behind the work is to significantly simplify the creation of grassland datasets. It will be greatly supporting the GALIRUMI project in this process.

My PhD Project: *Machine Learning-based Weed Detection for Agricultural Robotics* 
======
* Embedded in: **GALIRUMI EU HORIZON 2020 Project** (Galileo-assisted robot to tackle the weed Rumex obtusifolius and increase the profitability and sustainability of dairy farming) <img src="../images/galirumi_logo.png" alt="drawing" width="300" align="right"/>
  * The main objective of GALIRUMI is to deliver robot weeding for herbicide-free weed control in dairy farming. Robotic weeding will reduce the environmental impact of dairy farming by eliminating herbicide use and reducing exposure of farm workers to herbicides. It will also remove an important obstacle for dairy farmers to switch to organic production, thereby contributing to an increase in production of organically produced milk and higher incomes for farmers.

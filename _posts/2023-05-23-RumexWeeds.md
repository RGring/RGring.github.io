Today, we have finally published our RumexWeeds dataset! It targets the detection of the grassland weeds: Rumex obtusifolius L. and Rumex crispus L.. RumexWeeds includes whole image sequences with totally 5,510 images of 2.3 MP resolution and 15,519 manual bounding box annotations as well as 340 ground truth pixels-wise annotations, collected at 3 different farms and 4 different days in summer and autumn 2021. Additionally, navigational robot sensor points from GNSS, IMU and odometry are recorded. More detailed information can be found [here](https://dtu-pas.github.io/RumexWeeds/).

It is a big milestone in the project for me.
